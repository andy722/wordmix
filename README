DESCRIPTION

Some C code written in 2009 (approximately, judging by file dates) as a favor 
for a friend of a friend. I really don't remember who I wrote this for:-[, but 
this some kind of college task in beginning programming.


DETAIL

From a given letters (arbitrary phrase), returns all the valid words of Russian 
language which can be constructed of letters of given ones.
Highly inefficient implementation, stores all the possible words and then checks 
them for non-garbage.
Vocabulary is represented as an array in header file, which is generated 
(./text2c script) from a word list (wordlist.txt).
Uses wide characters.
